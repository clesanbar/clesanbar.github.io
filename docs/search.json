In particular, my research focuses on the relationship between environmental enforcement and state building, with a regional emphasis in Latin America. I also have ongoing interests in bureaucratic politics, causal inference, and state-society relations in frontier regions.\nI am the proud recipient of the Luksic Fellowship awarded by the Luksic Scholars Foundation.\nI received my BA in Political Science from the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile (PUC-Chile).\n(This website is a work-in-progress)"
