# Hello there!

I am a PhD student in the [Department of Political Science](https://polisci.mit.edu) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

My main fields are Comparative Politics and Methodology. In particular, my research focuses on the relationship between environmental enforcement and state building, with a regional emphasis in Latin America. I also have ongoing interests in bureaucratic politics, causal inference, and state-society relations in frontier regions.

I am the proud recipient of the [Luksic Fellowship](https://luksicscholars.org/en/program/mit-political-science-luksic-fellowship/) awarded by the Luksic Scholars Foundation.

I received my BA in Political Science from the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile (PUC-Chile).
