I am a PhD student in the Department of Political Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

My main fields are Comparative Politics and Methodology. In particular, I am interested in studying the relationship between environmental enforcement and state building, with a regional emphasis in Latin America.

I received my BA in Political Science from the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile (PUC-Chile).
