There has [never been](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.202348311) such a thing as untouched nature. [Few, if any, regions can be characterized as pristine](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1525200113). However, this does not mean that there is no beauty in the world. I like to photograph living things, both inside and outside the areas we have deemed worthy of conservation. You can take a look at my [photostream](https://www.flickr.com/photos/199874827@N02), or check out some samples below.
