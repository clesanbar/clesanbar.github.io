There is no such thing as Nature anymore. [Few, if any, regions can be characterized as pristine](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1525200113). However, this does not mean that there is no Beauty left in the world. I like to photograph living things, both inside and outside the areas we have deemed worthy of Conservation. You can take a look at my [photostream](https://www.flickr.com/photos/199874827@N02), or check out a couple of samples below.
